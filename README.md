# Number-Guessing-Game-using-Python
The number guessing game is a popular game among programmers. In the number guessing game, the program selects a random number between two numbers, and the user guesses the correct number.
To create a guessing game, we need to write a program to select a random number between 1 and 10. To give hints to the user, we can use conditional statements to tell the user if the guessed number is smaller, greater than or equal to the randomly selected number.
If the guessed number is lower than the randomly selected number, the user will see “too low”. If the guessed number is higher than the randomly selected number, the user will see “too high”. When the user guesses the correct number, “you guessed it right!!” will be displayed in the output.
